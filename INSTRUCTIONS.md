# Web Design 1 Project: Sporclone

## Description
Create a working clone of the game Sporcle (http://www.sporcle.com/). On this project, you will demonstrate your ability to integrate JavaScript into a web page as well as your ability to modify JavaScript to suit specific needs.

The instructions below describe how you will need to edit the template files to make a working game. ~~By the time you finish, you will have created three games. At least one of your games should be image based (like the logo quizzes).~~ No game should have fewer than 10 answers. ~~At least one of your games should have at least 20.~~

## Instructions:

Most of the numbered steps refer to a letter which identifies a particular location in the HTML and JavaScript files. Letters a-n are in index.html, and o-z are in sporclone.js. Follow the steps in order of the numbered instructions. The letters are only labels and do not reflect the order in which code should be completed.

Understand that on this project you are not writing large blocks of HTML or JavaScript from scratch. Nearly every step requires you to modify an existing line of code or to add a single line of code. If you find yourself wanting to do more than that, then you are probably misunderstanding the instructions.

Periodically you will be asked to preview and test your page. If the page does not work exactly as intended, then you should not move on from that section.

### Part 1 - Project Files

1. Save the game.html, sporclone.js, and main.css files to your dated Sporclone directory. If you preview the game.html file now, you'll see that it is an unstyled and non-functioning quiz on South Carolina mountain peaks.

~~2. Change the name of the game.html file so that it reflects the name of your puzzle. Be sure that your file name is in all lowercase letters. Use underscores instead of spaces.~~

### Part 2 - Quiz Appearance

3. Add a line of code at (b) to connect the HTML file to main.css.

4. Change the title tag (a) so that it describes your puzzle. Do not remove the "Sporclone:" from the title. Also, you can shorten your puzzle name. For example, "Name the ten highest mountain peaks in South Carolina" can be shortened to "South Carolina Peaks".

5. Change the h2 contents at (h) to reflect the topic of your quiz.

6. Change the h3 contents at (j) so that the input prompt is appropriate for your quiz.

7. Find an image representative of your game and save it to your images folder. Then crop the image so that it is a perfect square. The CSS is written to scale the image automatically, but the image still shouldnâ€™t be too large as it will slow down page load time. If necessary resize your image so that it is no larger than 160x160 pixels. Edit the image source (g) so that your image appears as an icon for your game.

8. Edit the footer (m) to give yourself credit for making the quiz. Use your first name and last initial only.

9. Edit the table (l) to provide space for each answer. The IDs of the span tags for each answer must be answer0, answer1, answer2, etc. Choose dimensions for your table that best display your answers. If possible, prevent the need to scroll while playing. DO NOT ACTUALLY TYPE ANY ANSWERS INTO THE TABLE.

Preview your HTML page. At this point you see that the page has a nice layout since you have applied the CSS. Make sure the title tag is correctly displaying in the browser tab and that heading text indicates the topic of your quiz. The image icon should display next to the heading that states the topic of your quiz. The text next to the input should clearly indicate what should be entered. The dimensions of the table should provide enough spaces for all answers. Your name should be in the footer. Since you haven't modified any of the JavaScript, the quiz is still not functional. However, the appearance of the quiz should be correct.

DO NOT MOVE ON UNLESS EVERYTHING TO THIS POINT WORKS CORRECTLY.

### Part 3 - JavaScript Configuration

10. Locate the script tags containing the game configuration variables. Edit the answers array (c) to contain all answers to your quiz. Be sure that each value is in quotes. It is not necessary to account for differences in spacing or punctuation when listing the answers. During game play, all non-alphanumeric characters are stripped and characters are converted to lowercase before guesses and answers are compared. Therefore, including "Pac-Man" in the answers array will automatically allow for variations such as "pac-man" and "pacman" to be accepted.

 If you have a question where you would like to accept multiple answers, then use the pipe symbol as a delimiter. The first answer is the preferred answer and will be filled into the table if any acceptable answer is given. For example, a Holidays game might have an answers array as follows:

 var answers = ["Independence Day | Fourth of July | July 4th", "Memorial Day", "Veterans Day", "Thanksgiving"];

11. Edit the time_limit variable (d) to give an appropriate amount of time (in seconds) to play the game.

12. Connect this page to the sporclone.js file at (n).

13. Add an onload event handler to the body tag (e) that calls the setup() function.

Preview the page again. You should see the starting score (0/number of questions) appear under the Score heading and the time limit should appear under the Time heading. If you do not see the score or time limit, then you have made an error in your configuration variables or in the line that connects the HTML file to the JavaScript file and will need to double check all steps in this section.

DO NOT MOVE ON UNLESS EVERYTHING TO THIS POINT WORKS CORRECTLY.

### Part 4 - The Timer

14. The start() function is responsible for getting the timer to start running. At location (p), set the value of the variable timer so that it uses the setInterval() function to call the tick function once per second.

15. As the game is played, a variable time_remaining tracks the amount of time the player has left to guess all of the answers. The tick() function is responsible for decreasing the time remaining and for ending the game when time runs out. Add a statement at location (u) that decreases the time_remaining variable by 1.

16. Add an onclick event handler to the start button (i) that calls the start() function.

 Preview your page now and test the start button. You should see the time count down. For testing purposes, you may want to use a small time_limit of a just few seconds so that you can see what happens when the clock stops ticking. If the start button does not cause your timer to count down correctly, then you need to double check the previous steps.

17. A formatTime() function has been included in the sporclone.js file. Apply the formatTime() function to time_remaining at (o) so that it is initially displayed in mM:SS form. Also apply formatTime() to time_remaining at (s) so that it is displayed in mM:SS form while the clock is running as well.

Preview and test the timer one more time. Make sure that the time is displayed in mM:SS form when the page is initially previewed and that it continues to display correctly while the clock is ticking.

DO NOT MOVE ON UNLESS EVERYTHING TO THIS POINT WORKS CORRECTLY.

### Part 5 - Game Play

18. The check() function is responsible for comparing user input to each element in the array of answers. One feature of the check() function is that it counts the number of correct answers and displays the total. The global variable correct holds the current number of correctly guessed answers. Write a statement at (v) that increases the variable correct by 1.

19. Write a statement at (w) that puts correct/total in the score span tag. The setup() function already does this. Look there to see how.

20. When the actual game of Sporcle is played, you may have noticed that you don't need to actually hit enter to get your answers checked. Instead, Sporcle responds to the onkeyup event. Add an onkeyup event handler to the guess field (k) that calls the check() function.

Preview and test again. Start the game and begin typing in answers. Each time you enter an answer correctly, it should show up in the corresponding location in the answer table and the score should update accordingly. If you guess all of the answers, then the game should end. Also, if time runs out, the remaining answers should be filled in the table at the end of the game. The game is still case-sensitive, so make sure you type your answers using the same case as in the answer configuration section when you play.

DO NOT MOVE ON UNLESS EVERYTHING TO THIS POINT WORKS CORRECTLY.

### Part 6 - Additional Styling

21. Add a statement in the start() function at (q) that changes the color of the time text to green while the timer is running.

22. Add a statement in the end() function at (x) that changes the color of the time text to red when the game ends.

23. The end() function fills in any missing answers once the game is complete. It should also highlight correct and incorrect answers. Add statements to the conditional at (y) that highlights each correct answer one color and each wrong answer another. (The variable id in the loop will contain the actual id for the answers location in the table. Highlight by changing the background color of the element with this id.)

At this point, your game should be fully playable. Try it out! It is okay to move on even if you aren't able to complete all steps in this section. Just undo anything you tried so that the game back to a playable state before you do move on. If you do figure out how to get these items complete later, then the extra games you will have made will all still work.

### Part 7 - Finishing Touches

24. The check function actually makes use of a function called isAlphanumericMatch() which strips all non-alphanumeric characters from two strings prior to comparison. However, the comparison is still case-sensitive. Modify the conditional statement at (z) so that both str1 and str2 are converted to lowercase prior to comparison.

25. We can make the start() function automatically place the cursor in the guess field so the user doesn't have to click in the field to play. Write a statement at (r) to do this. (Google 'JavaScript focus'.)

26. Rather than just have the time green while the game is being played and red when it ends, see if you can turn the color of the time yellow when under 10 seconds remains. This should be done in the tick() function. Youâ€™ll need to modify the conditional at (t) by adding an else if.

27. It is not required, but you may optionally write include custom CSS in the style tags located in the head of the games HTML file. This space is provided because there may be instances where additional CSS may be helpful because of varying table layout among games. (Donâ€™t modify main.css as it contains CSS which applies to all games.)

It is okay to move on even if you aren't able to complete all steps in this section. Just undo anything you tried so that the game back to a playable state before you do move on. If you do figure out how to get these items complete later, then the extra games you will have made will all still work.

### Part 8 - Additional Games

Creating extra games does not require any updates to the sporclone.js or main.css files. You'll only need to edit the game's HTML file. Make two copies of your working HTML file.

28. For each game, give the quiz an appropriate file name, edit title and heading tags, edit the game configuration section, and edit the table so that you have cells to correspond to each answer.

 Remember, at least one of your games should be image based (like the logo quizzes) and that no game should have fewer than 10 answers. At least one of your games should have 20 or more answers.

29. Edit the links in the "More Games" section (f) so that each game links to the two others you created.

### Part 9 - Final Review

30. Congratulations! Now you should self-grade each of your quizzes according to the checklist provided. Then have each of your games evaluated by a different classmate. After they review your games, make any changes necessary.
